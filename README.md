# Jigsaw Labs Module 2 Project

This repo was constructed to showcase the subjet material covered for [Jigsaw Labs](https://www.jigsawlabs.io/) and the material covered. I'm taking the basic [project guidelines](https://github.com/ludawg44/jigsawlabs/blob/master/03May20_Module%202%20Projects.ipynb) and creating a repo for your review and for future students. The hope is to add more case studies like this increasing the complexity and technical skills.

## Data
The data set was taken from [UCI's Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), more specifically the [Online Retail II Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). The generalic information is as follows:

> " This Online Retail II data set contains all the transactions occurring for a UK-based and registered, non-store online retail between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gift-ware. Many customers of the company are wholesalers. "

* Data Set Characteristics: *Multivariate, Sequential, TimeSeries, Text*

* Associated Tasks: *Classification, Regression, Clustering*

* Number of Instances: *1067371*

* Number of Attributes: *8*

The XLSX file is above the 25 MB limit for Github. I saved the converted CSV version in the `Dataset` folder or you can download it [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00502/). 

## Notebooks

The notebooks are in the [Notebooks](https://github.com/ludawg44/module2_project/tree/master/Notebooks) folder and in the following order: 

1. [Target Value Identification and Exploration](https://github.com/ludawg44/module2_project/blob/master/Notebooks/step1.ipynb)
2. [Identify Datetimes for Split](https://github.com/ludawg44/module2_project/blob/master/Notebooks/step2.ipynb)
3. [Numerical Values and DateTime Values](https://github.com/ludawg44/module2_project/blob/master/Notebooks/step3.ipynb)
4. [Boolean and Categorical Values](https://github.com/ludawg44/module2_project/blob/master/Notebooks/step4.ipynb)
5. [Coercing Datetimes and Handling NA Values](https://github.com/ludawg44/module2_project/blob/master/Notebooks/step5.ipynb)
6. [Train and Score Initial Model](https://github.com/ludawg44/module2_project/blob/master/Notebooks/step6.ipynb)
7. Plot/Coerce Target Variable 

e.g. `1. Target Value Identification and Exploration` is `step1.pynb`
